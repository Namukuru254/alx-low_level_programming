### Arguments to main

**argc** and **argv**

`argc
`

**argc** stands for `argument  count` which returns an `integer` number of arguments passed to the C program at runtime.

`argv`

**argv** stands for `argument vector`. A `vector` is a 1D array, thus `argv` is a 1D array of `strings`, each of which is an `argument` passed to the program.

---

- [x] [0-whatsmyname.c](0-whatsmyname.c) - Prints the name of the program i.e the executable file generated by `gcc` as the first argument to the program.

- [x] [1-args.c](1-args.c) - Prints the number of arguments passed to the program from the terminal i.e `argc`.

- [x] [2-args.c](2-args.c) - Prints all the arguments passed to the program as an array of elements i.e `argv`.

- [x] [3-mul.c](3-mul.c) - Computes the product of two `integer` arguments received. It uses the `isdigit` subroutine form the `ctype.h` to check for digit values and return an error otherwise. `atoi` utility from the `stdlib.h` headerfile is used for type casting between `char` and `int` data types.

- [x] [4-add.c](4-add.c) - Computes the sume of positive integers passed as arguments and returns an error if the argumnts passed are negative.

- [x] [100-change.c](100-change.c) - Computes and prints the minimum number of coins as changes for a given amount of money.
